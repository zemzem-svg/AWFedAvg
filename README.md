# AWFedAvg: Adaptive Weighted Federated Averaging




This repository contains the code for AWFedAvg, an adaptive weighted federated learning framework designed for dynamic resource slicing in next-generation wireless networks. Our approach combines Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with Federated Learning to enable privacy-preserving, collaborative training across multiple Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs).
